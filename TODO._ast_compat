List of things to do for _ast_compability :

ASTNG Motor
===========

Representation
--------------
* have a common representation for both _ast and compiler

* introduce Delete node for _nodes_compiler

* handle as_string for Ass/Del; fix decorators_as_string

* introduce arguments nodes (present in _ast) to trash some lambda weirdness

* ensure compatible representation for _nodes_ast function_factory

Tests:
======

make the IfNodeTC work : don't use string representation

are_exclusive
-------------
* more are_exclusive tests ... : we had a big unseen bug !


Pylint
======
* change all node attributes
* remove getChildNodes callings
* find solution for sibling
