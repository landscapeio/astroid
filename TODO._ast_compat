List of things to do for _ast_compability :

ASTNG Motor
===========

Representation
--------------
* have a common representation for both _ast and compiler

* introduce arguments nodes (present in _ast) to trash some lambda weirdness

* ensure compatible representation for _nodes_ast function_factory

Tests:
======

are_exclusive
-------------
* more are_exclusive tests ... : we had a big unseen bug !


Pylint
======
* change all node attributes

* remove / handle compiler.consts imports

* design_analysis . visit_if :
    len(node.tests) doesn't work anymore with astng2 / elif becomes else:if

* pylint.__init__ : why  
        ASTWalker.__init__(self, self)
  ? ASTWalker is no more used in astng

* checkers.rpython : We have no more Slice and SliceObj nodes
