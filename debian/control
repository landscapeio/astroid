Description: extend python's abstract syntax tree
 The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
 python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
 pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentialy
 governed by pylint's needs.
 .
 It extends class defined in the compiler.ast [1] module with some
 additional methods and attributes. Instance attributes are added by a
 builder object, which can either generate extended ast (let's call
 them astng ;) by visiting an existant ast tree or by inspecting living
 object. Methods are added by monkey patching ast classes.
