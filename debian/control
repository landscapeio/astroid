Description: extend python's abstract syntax tree
 The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
 python source code for projects such as pyreverse or pylint. 
 .
 It extends classes defined in the compiler.ast module with some
 additional methods and attributes. Instance attributes are added by a
 builder object, which can either generate extended ast (let's call
 them astng ;) by visiting an existant ast tree or by inspecting
 living object. Methods are added by monkey patching ast classes.
