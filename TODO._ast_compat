List of things to do for _ast_compability :

ASTNG Motor
===========
* Num + Str vs Const : check how to unify both nodes
* index : the method 'index' for the compiler.ast Nodes is used
on several places in astng but not available in _ast

Inference
---------
* Assign / Ass<something> : as all Ass<something> has been removed, 
all there infer method will have to be handled on the Assign node


Representation
--------------
* have a common representation for both _ast and compiler
* this should be exactly the same to make the IfNodeTC work

Tests:
======
_newstyle
---------
unittest_builder : test_newstyle_detection


Pylint
======
* change all node attributes
* remove getChildNodes callings
* find solution for sibling
