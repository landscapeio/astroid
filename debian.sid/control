Package: python-logilab-astng
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, python-logilab-common
Description: rebuild a new abstract syntax tree from Python's ast
 The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
 Python source code for projects such as pyreverse or pylint.
 .
 It rebuilds the tree generated by the _ast module by recursively walking down
 the AST and building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). The new node
 classes have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
 Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.
