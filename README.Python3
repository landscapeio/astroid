Python3
=======

Source
------

Python3 portage is made by running the 2to3 script on all modules::

  find . ! -path "*/test/*py" -name "*py" -exec 2to3-3.1 -wn {} \;


Dev

If you want to run the tests, simply remove the "! -path ..." option, hence
also refactoring the test files, including all data files.


Debian
------

For the Debian packaging, you can use the debian.py3k/ content against
the debian/ folder::

  cp debian.py3k/* debian/
